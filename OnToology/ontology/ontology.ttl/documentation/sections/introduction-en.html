This is a place holder text for the introduction. The introduction should briefly describe the ontology, its motivation, state of the art and goals.</span>

Ontologies have emerged in the last two decades as a powerful mechanism for
representing and integrating data on the web. An ontology is an explicit specifi-
cation of a shared conceptualization to describe top-level knowledge and domain
knowledge for a wide variety of tasks [32]. Ontologies can be represented in
multiple forms using visual editors, UML-based tools, etc. But they are usually
implemented using declarative and formal languages such as the W3C recom-
mendation OWL [2].
Like any other engineering artifact, ontologies evolve and suffer changes dur-
ing their lifecycle [30,27]. In this context, change representation is a challenging
task [34]; there can be several levels of representation depending on the gran-
ularity of said changes, the ontology language being considered, the specific
requirements of a project, etc. [13,3]. Recording these modifications in a consis-
tent, machine-readable format will enhance ontology engineering practices and
make ontologies more reusable in developments driven by knowledge graphs.
There are several tools and vocabularies related to ontology change represen-
tation. The Change and Annotation Ontology (ChAO) [21,33] is used for tracking
changes in Protégé, DynDiff [3] represents changes for the DynDiff tool, and the
Knowledge Graph Change Language (KGCL) [14] is specific for the biological
domain. However, these change representations have either been developed for
specific tools, not openly available, not documented, or domain-specific. These
conditions significantly hinder the reuse of these languages.
With that in mind the OWL Change Ontology (OCH) is presented,
an ontology to represent OWL ontology changes in RDF. Following the LOT
methodology [31], we provide a detailed and domain-independent approach to
describe the changelogs of any OWL ontology. The ontology is openly avail-
able5, both the code and the documentation; and it has also been developed
designed with adaptability, reusability, and extendability in mind, incorporating
general change operations that accommodate additional and increasingly com-
plex changes as the ontology evolves. With this proposal, our aim is to fill an
important gap in the ontology engineering methodologies and facilitate ontol-
ogy developers the maintenance of their vocabularies. The usefulness of OCH
is demonstrated over the EU Public Procurement Data Space, a real use case
where the ontology used, ePO6, publishes a new release typically every two to
three months.
