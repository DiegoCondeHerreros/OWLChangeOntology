### Ontology model

The following diagram shows a general overview of the classes and properties of the Conceptual Mapping vocabulary.

### Ontology (OWL)
The encoded core ontology in OWL can be found [here](ontology/ontology.ttl). 

### Shapes
To check that a change KG is compliant with the OCH ontology, shapes SHACL are provided in the [shapes folder](shapes/).

### Mappings
To generate a change KG with the OCH ontology, we provide a mapping template in [YARRRML](https://w3id.org/kg-construct/yarrrml) in the [mappings folder](mappings/)

### Examples
Some examples of how the language can be used to describe data for RDF transformation is shown in the [examples folder](examples/).

## Contribute
The management of issues and improvements suggested for this vocabulary is done by addressing [issues]() in the repository. If you are interested in collaborate with us in a new version of the language, send us an email or open a new issue or discussion!
